        <h2>Reflections: Computer Science Program & Capstone</h2>

        <p>
         The start of my academic journey had many challenges I had to overcome as quickly as I was presented to them. As my educational journey at SNHU comes to an end I now reflect on the strides that has brought me to where I am now. I started the computer science program back in 2022. While developing the ePortfolio I found the projects that showcase some of my finder skills and goals I have achieved while completing my coursework. I fondly remember finding it rewarding working through these projects despite having to ask various questions about the material. At first it was hard and confusing to find a solid methodology for solving the problems presented to me, but now I could say I find the process to be very exciting and rewarding in learning about skills that will help throughout my career as a software engineer.  
         </p>

         <p>
          The computer science program has given me the opportunity to explore various subjects that interest me greatly including those in the field of programming, data structures, algorithms and cybersecurity to name a few. In these course I have picked up valuable skill sets that show my abilities in a variety of different situations. I have not only become a better programmer as I first anticipated, but I have also been able to think more independently and creatively about the topics that influence the lives of many people. My desire to analyze and solve complex problems has been a major factor in the success I have found so far, and I plan to follow this pathway into the future. 
         </p>

         <h2>Enhancement One: Software Design & Engineering</h2>

         <p>
         For this milestone, I picked the artifact Grand Strand Systems from my CS-320 course. The application uses the Java programming language. The goal of the project is to create an application to schedule appointments, collect user information and provide a list of tasks to be completed. Automated tested is preformed by using JUnit testing to confirm if the given information is corect and does not result in a type or overflow error. Since the assignment was done early in my programming history it may have contained minor issues such as mislabel methods and variables. The enhanchcement hence aims to improve the overall readability of the application by fixing the inconsistencies found in the structure of the code. The enhanced version also features fixes to the test modules as the original artifact would not have ran them without errors.
         </p>
