        <h2>Reflections:  Computer Science Program & Capstone</h2>

        <p>
         The start of my academic journey had many challenges I had to overcome as quickly as I was presented to them. As my educational journey at SNHU comes to an end I now reflect on the strides that has brought me to where I am now. I started the computer science program back in 2022. While developing the ePortfolio I found the projects that showcase some of my finder skills and goals I have achieved while completing my coursework. I fondly remember finding it rewarding working through these projects despite having to ask various questions about the material. At first it was confusing to find a solid methodology for solving the problems presented to me, but now I could say I find the process to be very exciting and rewarding in learning about skills that will help throughout my career as a software engineer.  
         </p>

         <p>
          The computer science program has given me the opportunity to explore various subjects that interest me greatly including those in the field of programming, data structures, algorithms and cybersecurity to name a few.
