        <h2>Reflections: Computer Science Program & Capstone</h2>

        <p>
         The start of my academic journey had many challenges I had to overcome as quickly as I was presented to them. As my educational journey at SNHU comes to an end I now reflect on the strides that has brought me to where I am now. I started the computer science program back in 2022. While developing the ePortfolio I found the projects that showcase some of my finder skills and goals I have achieved while completing my coursework. I fondly remember finding it rewarding working through these projects despite having to ask various questions about the material. At first it was hard and confusing to find a solid methodology for solving the problems presented to me, but now I could say I find the process to be very exciting and rewarding in learning about skills that will help throughout my career as a software engineer.  
         </p>

         <p>
          The computer science program has given me the opportunity to explore various subjects that interest me greatly including those in the field of programming, data structures, algorithms and cybersecurity to name a few. In these course I have picked up valuable skill sets that show my abilities in a variety of different situations. I have not only become a better programmer as I first anticipated, but I have also been able to think more independently and creatively about the topics that influence the lives of many people. My desire to analyze and solve complex problems has been a major factor in the success I have found so far, and I plan to follow this pathway into the future. 
         </p>

         <h2>Enhancement One: Software Design & Engineering</h2>

         <p>
         For this milestone, I picked the artifact Grand Strand Systems from my CS-320 course. The application uses the Java programming language. The goal of the project is to create an application to schedule appointments, collect user information and provide a list of tasks to be completed. Automated tested is preformed by using JUnit testing to confirm if the given information is corect and does not result in a type or overflow error. Since the assignment was done early in my programming history it may have contained minor issues such as mislabel methods and variables. The enhanchcement hence aims to improve the overall readability of the application by fixing the inconsistencies found in the structure of the code. The enhanced version also features fixes to the test modules as the original artifact would not have ran them without errors.

         <h2>Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure</h2>

         <p>
         The second artifact I chose to enhance for the algorithms and data structure category is the Pet Check-in/Check-out Service I have done for IT-145. In this project I explored the Java programming language to create a simple dashboard for pet grooming services. It utilized multiple IF-Else statements which were new to me at the time. The original code did not utilize a data structure for the menu or variables of the project. I improved the artifact by implementing new dashboard features such as drop-down lists. I rearranged the widgets to make the dashboard more accessable to users.

         <h2>Enhancement Three: Databases</h2>

         <p>
          The third artifact I chose to enhace for the database category is the Grazioso Salvare Animal Shelter dashboard from the CS-340 Project Two. This was a project that used Python and MongoDB as the database framework. The main py file is called AnimalShelter.py and contains code for the CRUD: Create, Read, Update, and Delete functions. It also initializes the MongoDB accessing the animal shelter records. The main interface is stored on the .ipynb file which sets up the widgets for the interactive dashboard. The interactive menu options are used to filter the Austin Animal Center Outcomes data, a data table which dynamically responds to such filtering options as a pie chart, and a geolocation chart containing the location of the shelter. As shown in the image below, the code runs the header first opens the logo image stored in the same directory as the application and then displays the widgets which display data pertaining to the records of the animal shelter. Many of these elements I also used to create the github page as well.
         </p>

         <p>
          I improved upon the design of the dashboard by reworking the CRUD module to improve readability and replace unnecessary code. Some of the challenges I had to overcome were present when I first done the project originally and included elements not showing up on screen. I overcame the challenges by having regular testing sessions and rewriting small sections to see what area was causing the problem. I adjusted several parameters to change the layout of the menu to modify its look. This way the interface is better suited to meet user needs.
         </p>
